# 📬 Product People of Substack

> A curated list of product builders, AI tinkerers, and UX thinkers sharing their process on Substack.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

Substack's discovery algorithm favors big names and high-traffic posts. That’s great for validation—but not great if you’re looking for:

- Builders who ship weird stuff at 1AM and write about it at 2AM
- Product folks exploring the edges of AI, UX, and dev tools
- Honest, raw insight from people still in the trenches

This list was built because I got tired of seeing ghost-town newsletters or the same 10 famous results.

So, I made a list. Then the internet loved it.  
Now it's versioned, forkable, and lives in this repo.

## 📁 What’s Inside

- `Product_AI_Substack_Directory.md` — The full list of creators (name, newsletter, link)
- `README.md` — This file, explaining the what and why
- `submissions/` _(coming soon)_ — Community-submitted entries for future editions
- `CHANGELOG.md` _(optional)_ — Release notes, if we go full semver on newsletter lists

## 🧑‍💻 Who This Is For

- PMs building side projects
- UX designers exploring AI workflows
- Devs who want real product feedback
- Solo founders looking for community
- Substack readers who want substance, not just hype

## 🔎 What You’ll Find

Topics commonly covered by these creators:
- Building meaningful, trusted products
- Shipping with AI (without the buzzwords)
- Ethical UX, neurodesign, and human-centered dev
- Product process transparency (think: public roadmaps, audits, launch diaries)
- Not thought leadership. Just people doing the thing.

## 📡 How To Use This Repo

- Browse the list in `Product_AI_Substack_Directory.md`

## ⚠️ No Rankings. 

This list is **unbiased by follower count**

Because quality ≠ quantity.  
And some of the best builders are just getting started.
